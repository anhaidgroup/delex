## How to Use Delex

### Tutorial and Examples

Here's a [tutorial](https://github.com/anhaidgroup/sparkly/blob/main/doc/delex-tutorial.pdf) written by Dev Ahluwalia in case you want a step-by-step guide of using Delex, and here are multiple [examples of running Delex](https://github.com/anhaidgroup/delex/tree/main/examples).

We strongly recommend reading the tutorial first, then check out the examples. But if you are impatient, then you can also jump directly to trying to run the examples.

When trying to run Delex on a cluster of machines, you should also read this [short note](https://github.com/anhaidgroup/sparkly/blob/main/doc/note-on-input-sparkly-delex.md) about the location of the input for Delex.
