## How to Install Delex on a Single Machine

You can install and run Delex on a single machine. If you have relatively small tables, or just want to experiment with Delex, this is often sufficient. Otherwise you may consider installing and running Delex on [a cluster on cloud](./install-cloud-based-cluster.md) (such as AWS). 

### Overview

The installation process consists of the following: 
1. Install Python 3, Sparkly (+ its dependencies), and PyLucene (+ its dependencies).
2. Pip install Delex (+ its dependencies) from either PyPI or GitHub.

### Options

We currently offer the following ways to install Delex on a single machine: 
* [Installing on Linux](./install-linux-single-machine.md)
* [Installing on MacOS](./install-macos-single-machine.md)
