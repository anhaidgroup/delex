## How to Install Delex on a Single Machine

You can install and run Delex on a single machine. If you have relatively small tables, or just want to experiment with Delex, this is often sufficient. Otherwise you may consider installing and running Delex on [a cluster of machines](./install-cloud-based-cluster.md) (such as on Amazon Web Services). 

We currently offer the following ways to install Delex on a single machine: 
* [Installing on Linux](./install-linux-single-machine.md)
