# Step-by-step guide to running Delex
This guide is a step-by-step guide to running Delex. FOr this guide, we will assume that you have already installed everything from the provided installation guides.

## Step One: Download datasets
To begin, we need to download the datasets from the GitHub. Navigate to the dblp_acm folder here: https://github.com/anhaidgroup/delex/tree/main/examples/data/dblp_acm. Then, click on 'gold.parquet' and click the download icon at the top. Repeat this for 'table_a.parquet' and 'table_b.parquet'. Now, using your file manager on your computer, move these all into one file called 'dblp_acm'.

## Step Two: Create Python file
Within the 'dblp_acm' directory, create a file called 'example.py'. We will use this Python file to walkthrough the code.

Note: Make sure your virtual environment is activated. The 'further pointers' section in the installation guide has a reminder of how to do this. Then, to run this file throughout this walkthrough, use your terminal to navigate to the 'dblp_acm' directory and run python example.py.

## Step Three: Import dependencies
Now, we can open up the 'example.py' file. Before we begin, we first need to import all of the necessary packages that we will use.

```
from pathlib import Path

import sys
sys.path.append(str(Path().resolve().parent))
import os
os.environ['PYTHONPATH'] = str(Path().resolve().parent)

from pyspark import SparkConf
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
import pyspark.sql.functions as F


from sbl.lang.predicate import (
        BM25TopkPredicate,
        JaccardPredicate,
        EditDistancePredicate,
        SmithWatermanPredicate,
        JaroPredicate, 
        JaroWinklerPredicate, 
        CosinePredicate, 
        ExactMatchPredicate
)

from sbl.lang import BlockingProgram, DropRule, KeepRule
from sbl.tokenizer import StrippedWhiteSpaceTokenizer, QGramTokenizer
from sbl.execution.plan_executor import PlanExecutor
import operator
import psutil
```

## Step Four: Initialize Spark
Next we need to initialize Spark. For this example we are doing everything in a local setup, in particular, all files are stored on the local file system and we are running Spark in local mode. 

```
# enable pyarrow execution, recommended for better performance
conf = SparkConf()\
        .set('spark.sql.execution.arrow.pyspark.enabled',  'true')

# initialize a local spark context
spark = SparkSession.builder\
                    .master('local[*]')\
                    .config(conf=conf)\
                    .appName('Basic Example')\
                    .getOrCreate()
```

### Data
With the repository we have provided a small sample dataset called dblp_acm in parquet format. This is a small dataset of paper citations with about 1000 rows per table.

```
# path to the test data directory
data_path = (Path().resolve()).absolute()

# table to be indexed, generally this should be the table with fewer rows
index_table_path = data_path / 'table_a.parquet'
# table for searching
search_table_path = data_path / 'table_b.parquet'
# the ground truth, i.e. the correct matching pairs
gold_path = data_path / 'gold.parquet'
```

## Step Five: Read the Data
Once Spark is initialized, we can then read all of our data into Spark dataframes

```
# read all the data as spark dataframes
index_table = spark.read.parquet(f'file://{str(index_table_path)}')
search_table = spark.read.parquet(f'file://{str(search_table_path)}')
gold = spark.read.parquet(f'file://{str(gold_path)}')

index_table.printSchema()
```

## Step Six: Create a Blocking Program
Next we need to define our blocking program. For this basic example, we will define a very simple blocking program that returns all pairs where the Jaccard scores using a 3gram tokenizer are greater than or equal to .6. To do this we define a BlockingProgram with a single KeepRule which has a single JaccardPredicate.

```
prog = BlockingProgram(
        keep_rules = [
                KeepRule([ JaccardPredicate('title', 'title', QGramTokenizer(3), operator.ge, .6)])
            ],
        drop_rules = [],
    )
```

In terms of SQL this program is equivalent to

```
SELECT A.id, B.id
FROM index_table as A, search_table as B
WHERE jaccard_3gram(A.title, B.title) >= .6
```

## Step Seven: Execute a Blocking Program
Next, we create a PlanExecutor and execute the BlockingProgram by calling .execute(). Notice, that we passed optimize=False and estimate_cost=False as arguments, these parameters control the plan that is generated, which will be explained in a separate example.
```
executor = PlanExecutor(
        index_table=index_table, 
        search_table=search_table,
        optimize=False,
        estimate_cost=False,
)

candidates, stats = executor.execute(prog, ['_id'])
candidates = candidates.persist()
candidates.show()
```

## Step Eight: Compute Recall
Finally, we can compute recall. As you can see, the output of the PlanExecutor is actually grouped by the id of search_table. This is done for space and computation effeicency reasons. To compute recall we first need to 'unroll' the output and then do a set intersection with the gold pairs to get the number of true positives.

```
# unroll the output
pairs = candidates.select(
                    F.explode('ids').alias('a_id'),
                    F.col('_id').alias('b_id')
                )
# total number 
n_pairs = pairs.count()
true_positives = gold.intersect(pairs).count()
recall = true_positives / gold.count()
print(f'n_pairs : {n_pairs}')
print(f'true_positives : {true_positives}')
print(f'recall : {recall}')

# remove the dataframe from the cache
candidates.unpersist()
```
